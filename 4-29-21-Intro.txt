Subject: Introduction to Mentor's Corner

Hi there:

I am the dedicated mentor for the Cloud Engineer Boot Camp and Advanced
Cloud Engineer Boot Camp programs. As you have probably discovered,
there is a lot of information you need to acquire and retain.

To help you progress, I will periodically send out tips and suggestions.

If you are making good progress and are on target to finish the program
in 6 to 12 months- congratulations! Stay the course. You are doing
great. Keep it up. My advice may not be as applicable to you. As the
old adage goes, if it ain't broke, don't fix it!

Here are a few tips to help you progress successfully:

To avoid feeling overwhelmed, focus on where you are in the set of courses
and work, step by step, through that course. Worry about future courses
when you get there.

Schedule times and days when you will work through a course or practice
for an exam. Involve your family and friends. Let them know it is
important for you to carve out time for yourself.

Work through an entire chapter, including lab practice, versus working for
30 or 60 minutes and stopping mid-chapter. This way, you can capture and
absorb the whole concept rather than needing several minutes to figure
out where you stopped and gather the context again.

Reward yourself for working through a chapter and labs. Allow yourself
to do things you enjoy when you have completed a work session.

Learning Linux and Cloud concepts is a large task. I have more advice for
doing this and will share those suggestions in future communications. If I
can help with specific advice, reach out and contact me. Please remember
that technical information should come from the Forums and the office
hours, however, I can share tips to help you be successful in the Cloud
Boot Camp programs. Until next time, keep working on those courses
and Labs!

Regards,

Kevin--Bootcamp Mentor
